    <p>
      Overcrossing could be a problem, if our data is basically linear with some
      noise, giving too many feature crosses might make the model overfit to the
      noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we want as simple as a model as possible, and if the weights of some
      features are way bigger the others, that might suggest an overcomplicated
      model. To avoid this our model needs some kind of regularization, to
      minimize complexity.
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">L<sub>2</sub> Regularization</p>
    <p>
      L<sub>2</sub> Regularization consists of making the model minimize not
      only the loss but also the sum of the weights squared, times some constant
      that depends on the data, if training data and test data are very similar,
      the constant will be very low.
