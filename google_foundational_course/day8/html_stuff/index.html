    <p class="subtitle">Simplicity</p>
    <p>
      Overcrossing could be a problem, if our data is basically linear with some
      noise, giving too many feature crosses might make the model overfit to the
      noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we want as simple as a model as possible, and if the weights of some
      features are way bigger the others, that might suggest an overcomplicated
      model. To avoid this our model needs some kind of regularization, to
      minimize complexity.
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">L<sub>2</sub> Regularization</p>
    <p>
      L<sub>2</sub> Regularization consists of making the model minimize not
      only the loss but also the sum of the weights squared, times some constant
      that depends on the data, if training data and test data are very similar,
      the constant will be very low.
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">Logistic Regression</p>
    <p>
      For some data we might only need a probability, for example for a coin
      toss. This probability is going to help us make predictions. To do that we
      use linear logistic regression that has values only between 0 and 1, a
      sigmoid function has those characteristics.
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">Loss and regularization</p>
    <p>
      For linear regression we use <b>squared losses</b>, for logistic
      regression we uses <b>Log Loss</b>. Regularization is very important in
      logistic regression, since the sigmoid tends to zero or one at plus or
      minus infinity, the model will push the weights so high, or so low, just
      to get there, and in no time we would have an overfit model. To avoid this
      we can use both <b>L<sub>2</sub> regularization </b> or
      <b>stopping early</b>.
