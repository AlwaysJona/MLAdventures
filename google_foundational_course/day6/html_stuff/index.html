    <p class="subtitle">Programming excercise on validation set</p>
    <p>
      The program run was basically the same as in the previous excercise, this
      time there was a division between <code>train_df</code> and
      <code>test_df</code>. And i added an argument to the
      <code>train_model</code> function which was
      <code>validation_split</code> effectively dividing the
      <code>train_df</code> in 2. When you get your results you need to make
      sure that when the model converges the training rmse and validation rmse
      are the same otherwise there is some problem either in the data or the
      model. In this case was the data, which was not properly shuffled. After
      shuffling the two rmse were about the same. Finally you validate your
      model with <code>test_df</code> and if the returned rmse is about the same
      as those of the training and validation then you're good.
