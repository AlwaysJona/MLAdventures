    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>
      Introduction to Machine Learning Problem Framing. Helpful to start getting
      into the mindset and framing the problems correctly. Next i'm going to
      start the ML Crashcourse. I think i'm going to be using TensorFlow, which
      will be my first ML Framework, so i'm excited to begin.

      So the course begins with a review of the terms that I already studied
      yesterday, and continues with a mini-lecture about linear regression.
