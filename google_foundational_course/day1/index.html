    <h1>Machine Learning with Jona</h1>
    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>
      I have no idea where to start, so i'm gonna look at the courses that
      Google offers. I'm starting with Google developer Machine Learning
      Foundational courses. Today i went through the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>introduction to Machine Learning</li>
      <li>NumPy UltraQuick Tutorial</li>
      <li>Pandas DataFrame UltraQuick Tutorial</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The introduction was a nice reading, it didn't say much, it just explained
      the core concepts. The NumPy UltraQuick Tutorial was helpful to get me
      familiar with random function in NumPy. And last i never worked with
      Pandas' data frames so this last tutorial was really necessary.
