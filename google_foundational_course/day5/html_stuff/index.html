    <p class="subtitle">Generalization</p>
    <p>
      Today i learned the importance of generalizing your model, if you keep
      training on a given data set, your model could be overfitting it and may
      not be able do adapt properly to new data and would probably make poor
      predictions. A solution may be to divide your data into
      <em>training data</em> and <em>test data</em>, and to keep the model as
      simple as possible.
