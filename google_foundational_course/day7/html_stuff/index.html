    <p class="subtitle">Representation</p>
    <p>
      A great amount of time must be spent organizing the data and representing
      it correctly. For numeric features there is no problem since weights and
      biases are numerical, but for features that are strings we need another
      way of representing them. A solution might be
      <code>one hot encoding</code>, assigning a value to an element in a vector
      every time we run into that feature. We also need to pay attention to how
      the data is presented to us, if it is understandable, if there are any
      mistakes, if any number is out of range or if there are any
      <b>magic values</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">Cleaning Data</p>
    <p>
      You might need to scale the data, if a feature has a far bigger range than
      another, the model will pay way more attention to the first one than the
      latter. The data also needs to be scrubbed, any values outside 3 stddevs
      may compromise your model.
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">Feature crosses</p>
    <p>
      A feature cross is a synthetic feature that encodes non linearity. Since
      linear models can be scaled very easily, having linear features would be
      very helpful. You can cross two <code>one hot vector</code> that are not
      linearly related but their cross feature is. For example if we had: the
      feature x1 that could assume values <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> and x2 that
      could assume valuse <b>c</b> and <b>d</b>, then their cross feature,
      encoded in a 4D vector, tells us when we have <code> a AND c</code> or
      <code> a AND d</code> or <code>b AND c</code> or <code>b AND d</code>.
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">Programming excercise</p>
    <p>
      Saw how from a dataset i can turn a feature into a floating point value,
      which did not give a nice result so continued with binning the interested
      features, which was better, and finally feature crossed the two interested
      features and got yet a better result.
