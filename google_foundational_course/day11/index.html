    <p class="subtitle">Training Neural Nets</p>
    <p>
      Tensorflow handles the <em>backpropagation</em> on its own. But there are
      a number of ways in which it can go wrong
      <dl>
        <dt>Vanishing Gradients</dt>
        <dd>The gradient of the lower layers could get too close to zero, making the 
            training process very slow, or not event training at all. ReLU activation helps prevent this.</dd>
        <dt>Exploding Gradients</dt>
        <dd>On the contrary, gradients could also get very high, if the weights are very high, and the loss function
          may not converge. To avoid this normilizing the features helps.
        </dd>
        <dt>Dead ReLU Units</dt>
        <dd>Once the weighted sum gets below zero, a ReLU unit could get stuck, since it would always return 0.
          To avoid this lowering the Learning rate could be helpful.
        </dd>

      </dl>
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle"> Dropout Regularization</p>
    <p><b>Dropout</b> is another form of regularization, and it consists of skipping one random unit of activation
    for a single gradient step. The more units dropped, the greater the regularization. Like all regularizations, 
    it helps preventing overfitting.</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Multi-Class Neural Nets</p>
    <p>In a Multi-Class Neural Net we can use several binary logistic regressions, where we train a binary classifier for 
    each possible outcome using <b>one-vs-all</b>. For instance, given a problem with 8 different classes, 8 recognizers might be trained, one giving 
    a positive output, and 7 giving negative. This becomes very inefficient when working with a larger number of possible classes,
    and a better way to handle this would be with a deep Neural Net, in which each output node represents a different class.
