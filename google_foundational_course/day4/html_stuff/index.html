    <p class="subtitle">Linear Regression with Synthetic data</p>
    <p>
      very simple program that uses tf models and plots the model alongside the
      data, and then plots the rsme in function of each epoch. i did not write
      any of the code, it was just meant to get me used to tuning
      hyperparameters: learning rate, epoch and batch size.

    <p class="subtitle">Linear Regression with Real Data</p>
    <p>
      A bit more complex than the one before. i had to read the data from a csv
      using pandas. the difficult part was figuring out what where the best
      feature to analyze to get the best model.

      overall i'd say this was a great lesson, i kinda learned to use tf for a
      simple linear regression. which only requires 1 layer with 1 node since
      the linear regression was made with only one feature at a time. I don't
      know exactly what the tf functions i used really do but i have a vague
      sense of it and i'm definitely going deeper.
