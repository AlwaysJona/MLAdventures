    <p class="subtitle">Classification</p>
    <p>
      We might not want to predict a value, but to classify a group of object
      into a finite number of classes. For this the logistic regression might be
      really usefull, yeilding the probability of something belonging to a
      class, and setting a classification threshold: classifing an object if the probability is higher than a certain value. 
      <b>Accuracy</b> is <b>not</b> a good metric, because there could be
      class imbalances like 1 negative in 1000 positives, and the model by
      guessing always positive would be 99.9% accurate, put it wouldn't be a
      great model. </br>
      Other metrics we can use are <b>Precision</b> and <b>Recall</b>:
      <dl>
        <dt>Precision</dt>
        <dd>(True Positives)/(All positive predictions)</dd>
        <dd>when the model said "positive", was it right, did it say it too often?</dd>
        <dd>This tends to <b>lower</b> classification threshold</dd>

        <dt>Recall</dt>
        <dd>(True positives)/(Actual Positives)</dd>
        <dd>how often did the model correctly identify positives? Did it miss any?</dd>
        <dd>This tends to <b>increase</b> classification threshold</dd>
        
      </dl>
